# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Bionetta

Bionetta is a client-side framework designed to generate secure and private inference proofs using Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML). Unlike other frameworks, Bionetta assumes the AI model and its weights are public, keeping user inputs strictly private. Utilizing Groth16-based ZK-SNARKs, Bionetta efficiently executes neural network inferences, typically completing proofs directly on smartphones in under two minutes.
