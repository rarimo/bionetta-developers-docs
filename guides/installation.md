# ðŸ“Ž Installation

## Setting up the environment

To get started, begin by cloning the Bionetta repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rarimo/bionetta
```

Next, navigate into the project directory and set up a Python virtual environment named `env`:

```bash
cd bionetta  
python3 -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate
```

With the virtual environment activated, run the `install.sh` script to install all required dependencies and perform initial setup:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will prepare your development environment for working with Bionetta.
